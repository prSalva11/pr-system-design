# Job Scheduler Design

## Problem Statement
Design a **Job Scheduler** that can handle scheduling and execution of tasks at scale.

---

## Functional Requirements
1. The system should be able to **schedule millions of tasks per day**.
2. Support **flexible scheduling**:
   - Tasks that run **immediately**.
   - Tasks that run at a **specific time**.
3. Provide **task prioritization** to ensure critical jobs are executed first.
4. Handle **different types of tasks**, such as:
   - Email notifications
   - File processing
   - Error retries
   - Other background jobs
5. Support **cancellation and rescheduling** of tasks.
6. Provide **retry mechanism** for transient failures.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. **High Availability** – The system must not have a single point of failure.
2. **Scalability** – Must scale with growth in both **task volume and execution load**.
3. **Consistency** – Ensure **idempotency** so tasks are not processed multiple times.
4. **Replayability** – Ability to **replay jobs** for auditing or recovery.
5. **Security** – 
   - Encrypt **PII data in transit and at rest**.
   - Services should not be directly exposed to the public.
   - Implement **authentication & authorization**.
6. **Auditing** – Track all job submissions, state changes, and executions.
7. **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** – Failed jobs should be captured for later reprocessing or analysis.
8. **Observability** – Provide **metrics, logs, and alerts** to monitor execution health.
9. **Low Latency** – Immediate tasks should be executed with minimal delay.
